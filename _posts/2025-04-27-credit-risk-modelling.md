### Summary
Developed a machine learning model to predict the probability of loan default based on borrower features such as income, credit history, and debt-to-income ratio.  
Used logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost classifiers to optimize predictive performance.

### Methods
- Data cleaning and feature engineering
- Class imbalance handling with SMOTE
- Model evaluation using AUC-ROC and precision-recall curves
- Hyperparameter tuning with cross-validation

### Key Results
- Achieved an AUC score of 0.86 on the validation set.
- XGBoost performed best overall, balancing recall and precision effectively.

### Finance Relevance
Accurate credit risk modeling helps financial institutions minimize loan defaults, optimize lending strategies, and improve overall portfolio quality.
