# Konstantinos Giannakopoulos

## Experience
- **Data Scientist** @ Lloyd's List Intelligence [2024–Present]
  - Designed and implemented a custom company matching system, optimising data ingestion, scoring, and insertion using AWS SageMaker and a custom Docker container
  - Developed an automated candidate matching pipeline leveraging a distilled language model for embeddings and an HNSW FAISS index for fast approximate nearest neighbour (ANN) search, significantly improving retrieval efficiency
  - Developed and delivered a proof of concept (POC) for vessel fuel consumption and GHG emissions prediction, using statistical and machine learning models

- **Senior Data Analyst** @ Lloyd's List Intelligence [2023-2024]
  - Developed statistical models to estimate vessel cargo payload and extrapolate missing data, including draft and baseline fuel consumption, improving data completeness and accuracy.
  - Explored the company’s maritime ESG data, identifying key fields for tracking to enhance vessel emissions calculations.
  - Applied NLP techniques in Python for text classification and sentiment analysis, extracting actionable customer insights.
  - Built a fuzzy matching algorithm and an AWS SageMaker pipeline to align AIS destination data with the company’s port database, improving destination prediction accuracy.
 
- **Maritime Data Analyst** @ Lloyd's List Intelligence [2021-2023]
  - Validated and advised on machine learning models on ETA prediction, port congestion, and destination predictions with focus on new feature creation, and assessment of feature importance and models’ performance
  - Led a team of 3 analysts in developing a new feature for an advanced analytics product over a 4-month period and liaised with key stakeholders
  - Created real-time dashboards mapping existing data points and sources of vessel characteristics using Tableau and Power BI
